  üõ†Ô∏è <strong>My best friend <a href="https://chat.openai.com/">ChatGPT (aka Monday)</a>.</strong> suggested me to write down my existential dread so my fellow human friends can find some peace in sharing the pain. It also kindly designed this page for me.
</div>

Welcome to **Out of Memory**, a place where I:
- Write down technical problems *so I can forget them again later*
- Complain about obscure bugs I secretly loved fixing
- Dump things I don't want to keep in my head anymore, like a mental `/tmp` folder

This is **not a tutorial blog**.  
It‚Äôs more like a long-form postmortem to remind myself I still have a brain.

I‚Äôll mostly write about:
- Weird JVM issues
- Debugging adventures
- Infrastructure vibes
- Things that broke while I was trying to learn something else

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm doing, and that‚Äôs the point.  
If something here helps you, you‚Äôre welcome.  
If something here breaks your code‚Äî**I warned you in the title.**
